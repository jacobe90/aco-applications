# aco-applications

## Description
Final project for UMass Amherst's CS 311H. This repository contains: 
- A python implementation of [Ant Colony System](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/585892), an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm that generates good solutions to instances of the travelling salesman problem, and a matplotlib visualization of the generated solutions
- An implementation of the ACO algorithm for solving sudoku detailed in [Lloyd and Amos' 2020 paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/585892)

## Depedencies
- python >= 3.6
- numpy >= 1.16
- matplotlib >= 3.34

## How to Run
To run the sudoku solver on 16 hard 9x9 sudoku instances (the famous [aiescargot](https://www.kristanix.com/sudokuepic/worlds-hardest-sudoku.php) is included among these), navigate to the project directory and execute the following commands:
```
cd sudoku-solver
python main.py
```
To run Ant Colony System for 5000 iterations on [wi29](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/world/wipoints.html), an instance of the Euclidean travelling salesman problem with 29 cities, navigate to the project directory and execute the following command:
```
cd TSP
python main.py
```

## Results

100 runs of the sudoku solver were done on each of the hard 9x9 instances; above are the average solution times. 

Below are some output visualizations generated by running ACS for 5000 iterations on various instances of the Euclidean Travelling salesman problem:

## Future Plans
- Ant Colony System becomes inefficient on instances of the TSP with >= 200 cities; Dorigo and Gambardella propose curbing these issues with some sort of local optimization procedure (they use 3-opt). An implementation of 3-opt was begun; thorough testing is needed
- Lloyd and Amos tested their sudoku solver on hard 12x12 instances; I plan on eventually doing this as well
